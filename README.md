# Bosca

Bosca is a personal file management system implemented in micro-service architecture.

## To run the project
The easiest way to run the project is to open it in IntelliJ IDEA. The script to run each service has been configed within IDEA project.

### Following steps should be taken to run the project smoothly:

1. Run docker of Zipkin locally, and map the ports to let local services user it:

   ```zsh
   docker run -d -p 9411:9411 openzipkin/zipkin
   ```

2. Run docker of RabbitMQ locally, map the ports to local services and configure admin user:

   ```shell
   # run RabbitMQ
   docker run -d -p 15672:15672 -p 5672:5672 rabbitmq:3-management
   
   # config admin user
   docker exec -i -t <docker_container_id> bin/bash
   rabbitmqctl add_user bosca h4pHR*aAYhD6_z99oGkv
   rabbitmqctl set_permissions -p / bosca ".*" ".*" ".*"
   rabbitmqctl set_user_tags bosca adminstrator
   rabbitmqctl list_users
   ```

3. Run Config Server in IDEA, and wait the process to finish.
4. Run Service Discovery and API Gateway in IDEA.
5. Run User-WS, File-WS and Metadata-WS in IDEA.



*Now the project is connected my AWS S3 and AWS RDS. For test, you can just use existing configuration. In other scenario, you had better connect it to your own AWS S3 and AWS RDS or local Mysql Database. To do this, you need to create them on AWS and modify application.yml in BoscaConfiguration repository.*
